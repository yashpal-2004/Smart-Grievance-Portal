## Architecture Explanation

NexusCampus follows a **Serverless Full-Stack Architecture**:
- **Client-Side:** React handles the UI and state management. Real-time listeners (`onSnapshot`) ensure the UI stays in sync with the database without manual refreshes.
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Firebase Firestore acts as the real-time NoSQL database. Firebase Auth handles secure Google-based authentication.
- **Security:** Firestore Security Rules enforce data integrity and ownership at the database level.
- **AI Layer:** Groq API is integrated directly into the frontend for real-time wellness and medical assistance.
